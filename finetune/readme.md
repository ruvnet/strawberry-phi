A Python script that makes user request prompts dynamic based on a guidance prompt. This means the script will generate user prompts dynamically, ensuring a wider variety and relevance according to the specified guidance.

**Key Features of the Refactored Script:**

- **Dynamic Prompt Generation:** Uses a guidance prompt to generate diverse user requests dynamically.
- **Asynchronous and Concurrent Execution:** Leverages `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for efficient API calls.
- **Configurable Variables:** Includes variables for concurrent processes and other configurations.
- **Model Specification:** Uses the `gpt-o1-mini` model as requested.
- **Reflective Generation:** Incorporates previous responses to inform new ones.

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Dynamic User Request Generation:**

   - **Guidance Prompt:** Added a `GUIDANCE_PROMPT` variable that instructs the AI to generate a diverse set of complex user requests.
   - **Function `generate_user_requests`:** Created this asynchronous function to generate user prompts based on the guidance prompt. It requests multiple completions (`n` completions) in a single API call to efficiently generate multiple prompts.

2. **Adjustments in `main` Function:**

   - **User Requests Retrieval:** Calls `generate_user_requests` to obtain dynamic prompts before generating training examples.
   - **Example Count Adjustment:** Checks if the number of generated user requests is less than `NUM_EXAMPLES` and adjusts accordingly to prevent errors.
   - **Iteration Over Prompts:** Iterates over the dynamically generated prompts to create training examples.

3. **Concurrency and Asynchronous Processing:**

   - Maintains the use of `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for asynchronous and concurrent API requests.
   - Uses `asyncio.Semaphore` to limit the number of concurrent requests based on `CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`.

4. **Error Handling:**

   - Enhanced error handling in `generate_user_requests` to retry in case of failures.
   - Included informative print statements to trace errors and progress.

5. **API Request Parameters:**

   - Adjusted `max_tokens` and `temperature` in the API calls to balance between response length and creativity.
   - Set `n` parameter in `generate_user_requests` to request multiple completions in one call.

6. **Unicode Handling:**

   - Used `ensure_ascii=False` in `json.dumps` to correctly handle any Unicode characters in the output.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **API Rate Limits and Costs:**

  - Generating both user prompts and assistant responses will increase API usage significantly.
  - Monitor your usage to stay within your rate limits and budget.

- **Quality of Generated Prompts and Responses:**

  - The diversity and relevance of the generated prompts depend on the effectiveness of the `GUIDANCE_PROMPT`.
  - You can fine-tune the `temperature` and `max_tokens` parameters to get more varied and creative prompts.

- **Error Handling and Resilience:**

  - The script includes retry logic with exponential backoff to handle transient errors.
  - Adjust `RETRY_LIMIT` and `BACKOFF_FACTOR` as needed based on your network reliability and API responsiveness.

- **Data Validation:**

  - Consider adding validation to ensure that the generated prompts and responses meet your criteria before including them in the training data.

**Example Output (`training_data.jsonl`):**

Each line in the `training_data.jsonl` file will contain a JSON object representing a conversation:

```json
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an advanced, multi-modal autonomous AI agent with exceptional capabilities."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Develop a strategic plan for entering the European market with our new tech product."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Here's a strategic plan to successfully enter the European market with your new tech product...\n\n1. **Market Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the European tech market...\n\n2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure compliance with EU regulations...\n\n..."}]}
```

**Final Notes:**

- **Security:** Remember to replace `'your_openai_api_key_here'` with your actual API key. Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly.
- **Customization:** You can adjust the `GUIDANCE_PROMPT`, `NUM_EXAMPLES`, and other parameters to better suit your specific needs.
- **Testing:** Before running the script at scale, consider testing it with a smaller number of examples to ensure it works as expected.
- **Compliance:** Ensure that your use of the OpenAI API complies with their [usage policies](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

By making these adjustments, the script now dynamically generates user requests based on a guidance prompt, enhancing the diversity and relevance of your training data for fine-tuning the GPT model.
