## Introduction

Strawberry Phi is a fine-tuning application for OpenAI's GPT models. The purpose of this project is to provide an easy-to-use interface for creating custom models tailored to specific needs. The goal is to enable users to fine-tune GPT models with their own data, resulting in models that perform better on their unique tasks.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The system is built using a modern web stack, including Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS. The backend interacts with OpenAI's API to manage fine-tuning jobs and model testing.

### Technologies Used

- Vite
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
- OpenAI API

### System Requirements

- Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- OpenAI API key

## Benefits and Features

### Benefits

- Easy-to-use interface for fine-tuning GPT models

## How can I deploy this project?

All GPT Engineer projects can be deployed directly via the GPT Engineer app.

Simply visit your project at [GPT Engineer](https://gptengineer.app/projects/5744d052-cf39-44c8-bd80-0b0b8047e504/improve) and click on Share -> Publish.

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain then we recommend using Netlify. Visit our docs for more details: [Custom domains](https://docs.gptengineer.app/tips-tricks/custom-domain/)
